        <h2>Lake Michigan</h2>
            
			<p> I like to visit the places which are filled with natural 
                beauty. Lake Michigan is one of such places. Lake Michigan 
                is one of the five Great Lakes of North America. 
                Lake Michigan Beach is an unincorporated community in
                 Berrien County in the U.S. state of Michigan.
                 It is the second largest of the Great Lakes by volume.</p>

            <h2> Niagara Falls</h2>

            <p> This is another example of natural beauty. I had been reading 
                about the falls of geographycourse of studyin my school, so 
                I was always eager to visit the falls. It is the collective
                 name for three waterfalls that straddle the international
                  border between the Canadian province Ontario and the American 
                  state of New York.Beautiful huge waterfall view that makes 
                  human mind wet. Watching Naigara falls was a memorial
                   experience for me. Wonderful ‘Maid of the Mist’ boat tour
                    of the falls gives a closer glance of the falls.</p>

            <h2> Grand Canyon national park </h2>

            <p> Millions of years of geological history gets revealed while 
                looking at the red hard rocks placed at grand canyon. Mather Point,
                 Yavapai Observation Station and architect Mary Colter’s Lookout 
                 Studio and her Desert View Watchtower are some of the popular
                  attractions for visitor. I made the trip of south rim. standing 
                  on Mather or Yaki Point and watching the sunrise and sunset over 
                  the East Rim was a great experience </p>

            <h2> Statue of Liberty (NY) </h2>

            <p> The Statue of Liberty is a colossal neoclassical sculpture on Liberty 
                Island in New York Harbor in New York City, in the United States.
                The copper statue,a gift from the people of France to the people of 
                the United States, was designed by French sculptor Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi
                and built by Gustave Eiffel.Though this is manmade sculpture, it is
                United state’s landmark and a welcoming sigh for those who enter
                through NewYork.</p>

            <h2> Disneyland park </h2>

            <p> Beautiful theme park that took me in the fairy tales that I have been
                 listening since my childhood. The park is created under supervision
                  of the Walt Disney who was a pioneer of the American animation industry.
                 The park is a dream for every child these days.</p>

            <h2> Las Vegas </h2>

                   <p>I was amazed when I read about the Vegas&apos; history. The strip and the city
                    was build to produce revenue and jobs for the people at such a dessert
                    place as the effect of gaming and tourism.This is really &quot;Fabulous&#160;Las&nbsp;Vegas&#34; 
                    as they call it.</p>

            <h2> Saint Louis </h2>

            <p>  The first place I started living in United States was Saint Louis.
                 It has become my <b>hometown</b> now as I have been living here since 6 years
                  and I have explored the city all the way. A very good place to live.
                  Far from metropolitian rush, crowds and traffic and still a place of music,
                  art and worship. Foody person like me, have explored some of the foods
                  that are known to have originated in saint louis such as
                 Ted Drews frozen Yogurt, Saint Louis stype-pizza &#38; Gooey Butter cake. </p>
